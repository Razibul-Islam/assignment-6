                    <strong>Var</strong> Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated
                    with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare
                    variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.<br>
                    <strong>Scope of var</strong>
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally
                    scoped or function/locally scoped.

                    The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable
                    that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

                    var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and
                    can be accessed only within that function.<br>
                    <strong>Let</strong>
                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.<br>
                    <strong>let is block scoped</strong>
                    A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Const</strong>
                    Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.<br>
                    <strong>const declarations are block scoped</strong>
                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

                    Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.

                    The main difference between forEach and map methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one.The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.
